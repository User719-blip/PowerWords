# What is this project?
 - a simple way to do commands on  Powershell 
- like to open a website you have do start chrome "https://google.com"
which is cumbersome to me here you can do just laucher search "LGTV" and its done 
- so basically i want design a system that wraps over existing commands and make it user acceable using script and little bit of cpp
- for now it has only 3 function find search and open 

# Testing
 
 - to test simplly clone the repo then add details to apps.json
 - apps.json is a file which contains names of applications and
   location of there exe file. vscode is allready added and should
   work every where (vscode : code)
 - to add new entries to the app.json run add_ap.sh(untested) or add_app.ps1
                                or
   windows .\add_app.ps1 -name "notepad" -path "C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe"
   mac/linux ./add_app.sh notepad /usr/bin/open -a TextEdit (untested may throw error)
                     
 ## How to Eexecute

 - compile launcher.cpp to launcher.exe  
 - then to run launcher.exe open vscode 
   //opens vs code only if path given in app.json
 - or launcher.exe opens https://github.com 
 - or launcher.exe search "how to write" 
//this will searche the web for query in default browser 
 - to search the query in specific browser use -engine keyword 
   launcher.exe search "how to write" -engine  github 
//searches on github can choose engine from search_engines.json or add new one
 - launcher.exe find document.pdf //searches file/folders and returns address
 - luncher.exe find -o doc.txt //opens file/folders at location
 - force testing also possible by running powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/win/core.ps1 Search "vscode"
 - replace search with any other option like find open etc

 ## Help Wanted 
     
 - write inno set up to create an installer
 - test the add_app.sh and core.sh 
 - modify the launcher.cpp to handle .sh 
 - add support of mac and linux systems 
 - suggest changes in code structure to make ut more optimise
 - Suggest any new fun commands to add to project
