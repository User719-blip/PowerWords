thing core.ps1 (core.sh too) is pure ai slop it may or may not run launcher.cpp is modified by ai it also has some flaws 
i have added some config to the json 
problem 1 is that app.sh and app.ps1 cannot R/W data to config file idk why ai says it is correct 
i tried serching through web it might be permission problem maybe idk
